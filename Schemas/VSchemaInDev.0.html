  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
  The VersionSchema.org project adopted this example for initial specification, XSD and XML documents.
  The VersionMeta tag is {VSchemaInDev.0} and is a "standard" schema provided by VersionSchema.org.
  It is a phase + counter type of version schema that defines three linear phases and a single counter for releases within a phase.
  </p>

  <p>
  Note that this scheme is intended for specifications and schemas only.
  It is not intended to be used to track tooling or other software developement.
  </p>

  <h2 id="fields">Fields</h2>

  <h3 id="developmentphase">DevelopmentPhase</h3>

  <p>
  Enumeration type with five possible phases. 
  The change rules for this field are arbitrary (decided by wetware).
  This is not a waterfall, work may progress in multiple phases, except Abondanded, simultaneously.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <div id="experimental">
        <em>Experimental</em>
      </div>
      <p>
      The initial phase for all work is the <em>Experimental</em> phase.
      Changes made in this phase can range from totally breaking to inconsequential bug fixes.
      Work products in this phase may transition to <em>Abanoned</em> or <em>Prototype</em> phase at any time.
      Except for testing and experimental tooling, no dependencies should ever be taken on <em>Experimental</em> work products.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Abandoned</em>
      <p>
      When it is decided that a work product is not worthy of further effort, it will be marked <em>Abandoned</em>.
      While unlikely, a work product may be transitioned from <em>Abandoned</em> back to <em>Experimental</em> at any time.
      It is likely that {VSchemaInDev.0} will be abandoned as TBD's are resolved.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Prototype</em>
      <p>
      Work products are more stable and generally directed toward predefined goals in the <em>Prototype</em> phase.
      Breaking changes are still allowed, but require concensus that they are required.
      Work products may be transitioned back to the experimental phase for any reason at any time.
      While highly unlikely, a work product in the <em>Prototype</em> phase, may be transitioned to the <em>Abandoned</em> state at any time.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>ReleaseCandidate</em>
      <p>
      <em>ReleaseCandidate</em>s are highly stable. 
      Only the most essential bug fixes are allowed in the <em>ReleaseCandidate</em> phase and those require concensus.
      Work products will remain in <em>ReleaseCandidate</em> phase, for at least twenty (20) working days, to allow stakeholders sufficient time for comments.
      The VersionSchema.org project is committed to transition all <em>ReleaseCandidate</em> work products to the <em>Transitioned</em> phase within one calendar year of entering the <em>ReleaseCandidate</em> phase.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Transitioned</em>
      <p>
      The work product has <em>Transitioned</em> into the maintenance phase.
      All future versions of the work product will be tracked under an as-yet undefined schema.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Allowed State Transitions</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Abandoned->Experimental</em>
      <p>
      Work products that have been <em>Abandoned</em> may be transitioned back to the <em>Experimental</em> phase.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Experimental->Abandoned</em>
      <p>
      <em>Experimental</em> work products may be <em>Abandoned</em> at any time for any reason.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Experimental->Prototype</em>
      <p>
      <em>Experimental</em> work products may be transitioned to <em>Prototype</em> when they are deemed to be complete and stable enough, that they are unlikely to regress in the future.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Prototype->Abandoned</em>
      <p>
      <em>Prototype</em>s can be <em>Abandoned</em> at any time for any reason.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Prototype->Experimental</em>
      <p>
      <em>Prototype</em>s can regress to <em>Experimental</em> at any time.
      This can happen, if the work product becomes blocked by unforseen issues that cannot be resolved without breaking changes, and concensus cannot be reached among the stakeholders.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Prototype->ReleaseCandidate</em>
      <p>
      <em>Prototypes</em>s can be transitioned to <em>ReleaseCandidate</em> status when the project and stakeholders agree that the work product is useful, stable and worth committing to a long period of maintenance.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>ReleaseCandidate->Transitioned</em>
      <p>
      <em>ReleaseCandidate</em>s MUST eventually transition.
      When concensus is reached that a release candidate should be moved into maintainance, it will be released unchanged, except for internal version strings and release notes, if any, with a version string of <em>Transitioned.0 {VSchemaInDev.<b>TBD</b>}</em>, where <b>TBD</b> is either 0, 1 or whatever VSchemaInDev.*.xml schema we're on at that point.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>PhaseCounter</h3>

  <p>
  Used to track releases within a phase.
  Starts at zero when the work product first transitions to the stage, then increments there-after.
  When the work product transitions from a higher phase to a lower one, the phase counter for that phase continues counting from where-ever it was when work had previously transitioned out.
  When a work product transitions back to the higher phase, that counter picks-up where it was left off.
  </p>

  <h2>Assurances</h2>
  <p>
  All releases will have been subject to some kind of review prior to publishing.
